        <Paragraph>
          After spending almost half a decade in Europe and more than a decade
          in IT industry, <strong>Senthil Kumar</strong>, software engineer by
          profession, has noticed that there was no proper guidance for students
          especially from rural areas to get into the IT industry. Senthil Kumar
          volunteered for various college events to guide students mentored them
          and helped them to prepare for their career.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Senthil Kumar</strong>, along with his like-minded friend,
          <strong>Dhileepan Dhanapal</strong>, decided to give back to the
          society through Education. They started <strong>MentorBridge</strong>{" "}
          in <strong>2024</strong> as a <i>Not-For-Profit community</i> to train
          students from rural areas in the latest technologies and prepare them
          for the real world.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Initially, they mentored students online through Microsoft Teams.
          However, they soon realized that they needed to be physically present
          with the students to provide them with the best possible guidance.
          Hence, they pitched the idea to the management of{" "}
          <strong>SSM Institute of Engineering and Technology (SSMIET)</strong>.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Principal of SSMIET and the placement team were also supportive of the
          initiative and provided the necessary resources to start the training
          program. Just like the coordinators, management team of SSMIET also
          believe in the power of education to transform lives.

          In the founded year 2024, the MentorBridge took a significant step
          towards preparing students for the real world by launching{" "}
